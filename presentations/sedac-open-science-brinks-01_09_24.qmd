## Presentation Outline

-   Learning objectives
-   Open Science Components
-   Technical details
-   Proposed analyses and outputs

## Learning Objectives

We are currently in the early development phases and need to adjust the narrative voice between 3 learning/content components:

- Water resources 
- Technical data
- Technical coding

## WSIM-GLDAS

WSIM-GLDAS is an open source dataset that characterizes surpluses and deficits of freshwater and the parameters determining these anomalies.

- Globally rasterized dataset issued monthly for 1948-2014
- Composite surplus/deficit anomalies
- Multitude of
